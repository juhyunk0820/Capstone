# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Capstone
캡스톤 프로젝트_실시간교통안내시스템

## 프로젝트 설명
### 개요
#### 1. 도로교통 이력 자료를 활용 -> 미래 교통상황 예측 및 이를 기반으로 한 추천 경로 제공
#### 2. 다양한 방식의 모델링 -> 도로 네트워크의 구간 별 미래 교통상황 예측 및 활용
#### 3. 설계 목적에 따라, 통행시간 최단경로 및 예상통행시간(Estimated Time of Arrival, ETA) 변화 최소경로 등 사용자 목적에 부합하는 추천 경로 제공

### 요구사항
#### 1. 데이터 수집
도로공사 차량 검지기 시스템(VDS) 데이터 등 다양한 자료 활용
#### 2. 모델링 : 도로구간별 미래 교통상황 예측 모델 + 경로 탐색 모델
#### 3. 아웃풋 : 출-도착지 입력 시 추천 경로 및 ETA도출

## 진행과정
1. 데이터 수집 및 전처리

2. 경로 탐색 알고리즘

3. 인공지능 모델 탐색 & 모델링

4. 서비스 구현 - Web
